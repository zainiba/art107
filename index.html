      <p style="font-family:Open Sans;" class="state">Location Tracking has become so integrated in our lives, we don't think twice about apps asking for tracking permissions. Often in social media apps it is used as another method of connecting with others. When you share your location with others via social media, Find My Friends, or things of that sort you are allowing others to expirence those things with you. Sharing location with family or friends can give everyone peace of mind but it can also stimulate feelings of anxiety and obsession. Users began to rely heavily on technolgy that has limits to tell them where others are and when things began to go awry it can become an unhealthy fixation.</p>

      <h3  style="font-family:Archivo Narrow;">Self-Imposed Blobs, Blender, 2020 </h3>
    <p style="font-family:Open Sans;" class="state"> This animation is a product of my reflections on my expirience with anxiety. I thought that my anxiety was a result of external facotrs, the people and event happening around me. If I cut these things out of my life then my problems would be solved, right? It took a while to realize that the cause of my anxiety was my own perception of the things around me. I can't get rid of it if the source is me. It takes a lot of self-awareness to take a step back and consider if the way I am percieving things in a positive way. </p>

      <h3  style="font-family:Archivo Narrow;">Synchronized Pulses, Blender, 2020 </h3>
    <p style="font-family:Open Sans;" class="state">Phones have become extensions of ourselves, we use and rely on them for everything. These small devices are our source of communication with the entire world. The day is filled with rings and vibrations trying to catch our attention and
      grab a hold of us. The notifications turn into an addiction, seeing our screens filled with notifications releases dopamine and we enter into a loop of waiting for the rings that make us happy. After a while, the bombardment of
      notifications becomes overwhelming and anxiety inducing. A single ring or ding! can send panic throughout the body. The ringing synchronises with ourselves in an inseparable way.

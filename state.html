    <h1 style="text-align:center">My Statement</h1>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      This series of projects follow themes of anxiety, what it looks like and where it comes from. My personal experiences are generally what drive my art and I felt that this was a place I could grab from. My original concept was to research
      location tracking and sharing and that is where my first project, Light Eyes, comes from. As I continued thinking about the work I wanted to do I shifted my focus to anxiety that comes with technology and devices as well as trying to understand
      what anxiety looks like to me. I think that anxiety that surrounds technology and my devices is something fairly new to me. This is something I started experiencing only recently. As we continue to push through in all the Covid-19 lockdowns,
      sometimes I feel like my phone is the only connection I have to the world. But I realized that it causes me more unease than the feeling of connection. I took this series as an opportunity to practice my skills in 3D modeling using Blender. It
      was a software I had used a little bit before and I enjoyed the user interface. I wanted to explore Blender a lot more and I felt that if I used Blender
      as my medium for every project in this series then that would be successful.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      Light Eyes had started off as a research project about location tracking. I was initially intimidated by the idea of research based projects. However, after reading about other people's experiences or advice articles, I realized that research
      can be anything that allows me to develop a deeper understanding of my concept. The balloon in my model is meant to signify an object that nobody would think twice about and people are happy to carry them around. The eyes take it into a
      different aspect of how trusting we can be. Something that we don't give a second thought is actually watching us and rather than appreciating the object/balloon it becomes a source of worry.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      For my second project, Self-imposed Blobs, I wanted to explore what my own anxiety feels like to me and I wanted to create a visual representation of it. My original intention with this project was guided by my interest in learning about the
      Meta-ball feature in Blender. I felt the way they moved within this project was a good representation of how suffocating it can feel sometimes.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      In the final project, Synchronized Pulses, I was able to delve deeper into the role anxiety plays in my life. Rather than just coming from something I willingly share, I realized it comes from my main form of communication as well, texting.
      While I am very grateful for all the people that reach out to me sometimes I become overwhelmed by the number of messages I receive from all the people that want to know what I was doing. Sometimes I felt like I was giving up my time when I am
      not even with them in person. I felt every buzz of my phone reverberate throughout my body and the only relief was shutting my phone off.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      I am thankful to have created all three of these projects and I am glad I delved into the topic of anxiety. Sometimes I don’t take a step back to truly try to understand where my anxiety comes from and how it makes me feel about certain things.
      Because it is something I cannot see it was hard to create a visual representation that I felt was encapsulating my feelings, but I am really proud of how these pieces turned out and I think I was successful in representing my anxiety.

      Laurie Frick states “tracking data will be the ultimate 'data-selfie', personal data portraits gathered over time on our phone”. That is exactly how I think of tracking data, it is really like a definition of
      yourself.
